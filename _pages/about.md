# Biography

I am a fifth-year PhD student working on  deep learning in microscopy and AI for science with Prof. [Qionghai Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CHAajY4AAAAJ&hl=en) in [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University.  Previously, I received my B.E. degree in [Department of Engineering Physics](https://www.ep.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).


# Research

**Deep learning in microscopy**: Deep learning-enhanced microscopy is significant for advances in cell biology, pathology, neuroscience, and immunology. Typical topics that I am currently enthusiastic about are some deep learning methods with low data cost, such as image-denoising algorithms based on unsupervised learning, and neural analysis methods driven by simulation-supervised learning. 

**AI for science**: I am all in for creating innovative AI tools to fuel the next wave of scientific breakthroughs. The great revolutions caused by large models in artificial intelligence are profoundly reforming human society. I am working on crafting medical imaging diagnostic techniques powered by large image models. I am also interested in AI-enhanced cryo-electron microscopy imaging methods.
